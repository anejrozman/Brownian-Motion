# Brownian motion
In this article we motivate the idea of Brownian motion and give its mathematical definition. We define basic concepts such as a stochastic process, sample path, increment, filtration and stopping time. We present and prove some basic properties and results, such as the symmetry of Brownian motion, weak Markov property, strong Markov property, reflection principle and the surprising result that the sample path of Brownian motion is nowhere differentiable.
